# product-preview-card-component
This is my attempt at the product preview card component challenge from Frontend mentor.
In this challenge, instead of hard coding in the value, I tried using responsive values for group of elements.
Because of this, I'm not entirely sure the website is good. I am very open to feedback. Please let me know if you have any tips.
